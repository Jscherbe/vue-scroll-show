# @ulu/vue-scroll-show

Minimal component to create sticky scrolling based slideshow. Uses [Scrollmagic](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scrollmagic) library and position sticky to create scenes (like scroll keyframes). 

Note: This component just provides a way to create scroll based sticky presentations. It doesn't provide styling, slides, or animations. It does provide two optional child components, 'ScrollShowNav' for display a list of links to each scene in a given presentation, and 'ScrollShowProgress' which provides a progress bar.
